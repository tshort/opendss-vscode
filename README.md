# OpenDSS script package

VSCode package for [OpenDSS](http://smartgrid.epri.com/SimulationTool.aspx) input files.

Includes syntax highlighting plus a few snippets for entering some components, including lines, loads, transformers, and line codes and geometries.

This package closely follows a similar [package for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/language-opendss).

Along with the [julia-vscode extension](https://github.com/JuliaEditorSupport/julia-vscode), code from OpenDSS scripts can be sent to the Julia REPL and executed when Julia is in "OpenDSS mode". See the video below for an example.

# OpenDSS script package

VSCode package for [OpenDSS](http://smartgrid.epri.com/SimulationTool.aspx) input files.

Includes syntax highlighting plus a few snippets for entering some components, including lines, loads, transformers, and line codes and geometries.

This package closely follows a similar [package for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/language-opendss).
